We’re building an open SDK to collect location data (like GPS) from phones, for apps like yours

## Purpose

### Why is this project useful?

OpenLocate is supported by developers, non-profits, trade groups, and industry for the following reasons:

* Collecting location data in a battery efficient manner that does not adversely affect mobile application performance is non-trivial. OpenLocate enables everyone in the community to benefit from shared knowledge around how to do this well.
* Creates standards and best practices for location collection.
* Developers have full transparency on how OpenLocate location collection works.
* Location data collected via OpenLocate is solely controlled by the developer.

### What can I do with location data?

Mobile application developers can use location data collected via OpenLocate to:

* Enhance their mobile application using context about the user’s location.
* Receive data about the Points of Interest a device has visited by enabling integrations with 3rd party APIs such as Google Places or Foursquare Venues
* Send location data to partners of OpenLocate via integrations listed here.

### Who is supporting OpenLocate?

OpenLocate is supported by mobile app developers, non-profit trade groups, academia, and leading companies across GIS, logistics, marketing, and more.

## Requirements
- iOS 9+

## How OpenLocate Works

OpenLocate utilizes  several services within iOS’s CoreLocation API to provide timely and relevant location updates.
- `Visit Monitoring` API is used to determine locations the user has frequented by logging a location update for the entry and exit of a visit.
- `Significant Location Change` API is used to log significant movement in the user’s location. 
- Lastly, `Background Fetch` is used to periodically fetch the user’s current location.

Given that location updates are sparse, the context in which the location updates occurred in is recorded in location_context.

In order to minimize battery usage and network traffic to your server, the location updates are not transmitted immediately to minimize battery usage and network traffic to your server, but rather batched locally for sending at a defined interval. The default transmission interval is eight hours. Once successfully transmitted, the location updates are no longer stored on the device.

## Installation

Cocoapods

If you use cocoapods, add the following line in your podfile and run `pod install`

```ruby
pod 'OpenLocate'
```

## Usage

### Initialize tracking

1. Add permission keys for location tracking in the `Info.plist` of your application

For **Xcode 9:**
```xml
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>OpenLocate would like to access location.</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>OpenLocate would like to access location.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>OpenLocate would like to access location.</string>
```

If you are using **Xcode 8** you need one of these keys:
```xml
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>OpenLocate would like to access location.</string>
```
```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>OpenLocate would like to access location.</string>
```

2. Configure where the SDK should send data to by building the configuration with appropriate URL and headers. Supply the configuration to the `initialize` method. Ensure that the initialize method is invoked in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method in your `UIApplicationDelegate`

#### For example, to send data to SafeGraph:

Assuming you have a UUID and token from SafeGraph:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]? ) -> Bool {

    let uuid = UUID(uuidString: "<YOUR_UUID>")!
    let token = "YOUR_TOKEN"
    
    let url = URL(string: "https://api.safegraph.com/v1/provider/\(uuid)/devicelocation")!
    let headers = ["Authorization": "Bearer \(token)"]
    
    let configuration = Configuration(url: url, headers: headers)
    
    do {
        try OpenLocate.shared.initialize(with: configuration)
    } catch {
        print(error)
    }
}
```


### Start tracking of location

To start the tracking location, call the `startTracking` method on the `OpenLocate`. Get the instance by calling `shared`.

```swift
OpenLocate.shared.startTracking()
```


### Stop tracking of location

To stop the tracking call `stopTracking` method on the `OpenLocate`. Get the instance by calling `shared`.

```swift
OpenLocate.shared.stopTracking()
```

### Check the current state of location tracking

Call `isTrackingEnabled` method on the `OpenLocate`. Get the instance by calling `shared`.

```swift
OpenLocate.shared.isTrackingEnabled()
```

### Additional location updates via Background Fetch
If you would like more periodic location updates, you can enable background fetch to allow the application to poll for location updates periodically.

Ensure that `Background Fetch` mode is enabled in your project:
<p align="center"><img width="400" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLocate/openlocate-ios/master/Screenshots/BackgroundFetch-Cabability.png" /></p>

Additionally, implement the following method in your `AppDelegate`

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, performFetchWithCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void) {
     OpenLocate.shared.performFetchWithCompletionHandler(completionHandler)
}
```

### Using user's location to query 3rd party Places APIs

To use user's current location, obtain the location by calling `fetchCurrentLocation` method on OpenLocate. Get the instance by calling `shared`. Use the fields collected by SDK to send to 3rd party APIs.

#### For example, to obtain user location:

```swift
try OpenLocate.shared.fetchCurrentLocation { location, error in
  if let location = location {
    fetchNearbyPlaces(location: location)
  } else {
    debugPrint(error.localizedDescription)
  }
}
```

#### For example, to query Google Places API using location:

Google Places API: https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search

```swift

func fetchNearbyPlaces(location: OpenLocateLocation, completion: @escaping GooglePlacesCompletionHandler) {
        guard let coordinates = location.locationFields.coordinates else {
            completion(nil, GooglePlacesError.locationNotFound)
            return
        }

        let queryParams = [
            "location": "\(coordinates.latitude),\(coordinates.longitude)",
            "radius": "500",
            "type": "restaurant",
            "keyword": "south",
            "key": "<YOUR GOOGLE PLACES API KEY>"
            ] as [String : Any]

        Alamofire.request(
            "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json",
            parameters: queryParams
        )
            .responseJSON { response in
                debugPrint(response)
                guard let json = response.result.value as? [String: Any],
                    let placesJson = json["places"] as? [Any], !placesJson.isEmpty else {
                    completion(nil, GooglePlacesError.placesNotFound)
                    return
                }

                var places = [GooglePlace]()
                for placeJson in placesJson {
                    let place = (placeJson as? [String: Any])!
                    places.append(GooglePlace(json: place))
                }

                completion(places, nil)
        }
    }

```

#### For example, to query Safegraph Places API using location:

SafeGraph Places API: https://partners.safegraph.com/places

```swift

func fetchNearbyPlaces(location: OpenLocateLocation, completion: @escaping SafePlacesCompletionHandler) {
        guard let coordinates = location.locationFields.coordinates else {
            completion(nil, SafeGraphError.locationNotFound)
            return
        }

        let queryParams = [
            "advertising_id": location.advertisingInfo.advertisingId,
            "advertising_id_type": "aaid",
            "latitude": coordinates.latitude,
            "longitude": coordinates.longitude,
            "horizontal_accuracy": location.locationFields.horizontalAccuracy
            ] as [String : Any]

        Alamofire.request(
            "https://api.safegraph.com/places/v1/nearby",
            parameters: queryParams,
            headers: ["Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>"]
        )
            .responseJSON { response in
                debugPrint(response)
                guard let json = response.result.value as? [String: Any],
                    let placesJson = json["places"] as? [Any], !placesJson.isEmpty else {
                    completion(nil, SafeGraphError.placesNotFound)
                    return
                }

                var places = [SafeGraphPlace]()
                for placeJson in placesJson {
                    let place = (placeJson as? [String: Any])!
                    places.append(SafeGraphPlace(json: place))
                }

                completion(places, nil)
        }
    }

```

Similarly, OpenLocate SDK can be used to query additional APIs such as Facebook Places Graph or any other 3rd party places API.

#### Connecting user's location data to Wolfram Cloud for analytics using [Wolfram Data Drop](https://datadrop.wolframcloud.com/)

Data Drop is a service from Wolfram Research that makes it easy to collect data in a manner that proactively sets it up for computation, visualization, analysis, or other data processing operations. **Databins** store and add semantics to data while making it instantly accessible from all Wolfram Language and other systems through the Wolfram Cloud.

Once in a Databin, you can use Wolfram Language to create visualizations like the following, which were generated using UFO sighting location data from the [Wolfram Data Repository](https://datarepository.wolframcloud.com/):

<p align="center"><img src="https://www.wolframcloud.com/objects/q-partnerships/openlocate/geohistogram" alt="UFO Sightings GeoHistogram" align="center"></p>

Refer to the [Data Drop Quick Reference](https://www.wolfram.com/datadrop/quick-reference/home/) to learn more.

To send user's location data to a databin via the Data Drop Web API:

```swift
Alamofire.request("https://datadrop.wolframcloud.com/api/v1.0/Add?bin=pHUeJojI", method: .post, parameters: parameters, encoding: JSONEncoding.default)
func pushLocationToDataDrop(location: OpenLocateLocation) {

        Alamofire.request(
            "https://datadrop.wolframcloud.com/api/v1.0/Add?bin=<YOUR BIN ID>",
            parameters: location.locationFields
        )
            .responseJSON { response in
                debugPrint(response)
        }
    }
```

## Location Permission Opt-In Best Practices

OpenLocate requires users to accept the iOS's Location Permission in order to work correctly. It is therefore important to understand when and how to prompt for the location permission in order to maximize opt-in rates from users. OpenLocate takes care of prompting the location permission atomically for you when the `startTracking()` method is invoked. OpenLocate also takes care of remembering this started state across app launches, so you only need to invoke `startTracking()` once. You must decide  the optimal time to invoke `startTracking()` within your app however. Below are several articles that explain the different approaches that can be taken. Ensure you choose one that fits your app’s needs:
- https://medium.com/product-breakdown/5-ways-to-ask-users-for-ios-permissions-a8e199cc83ad
- https://www.doronkatz.com/articles/the-right-way-to-ask-users-for-ios-permissions-medium-1

## App Submission with OpenLocate
OpenLocate collects the advertising ID by default. If this is kept as-is, during the app submission process, please ensure that you disclose that you are collecting the advertising ID and the reason. This requires checking certain checkboxes under the section “Advertising Identifier” in the app store submission form; we recommend checking at least the following options, but you may want to check others depending on your app’s specific usage of the advertising ID.
Attribute this app installation to a previously served advertisement
Attribute an action taken within this app to a previously served advertisement
Limit Ad Tracking pledge: i.e. that the limit ad tracking setting will be honoured appropriately (see app submission form for more details)
